# Triangle-Classifier
This console application allows users to input three side lengths and determine the type of triangle they form. It identifies whether the triangle is equilateral, scalene, or isosceles and if it's a right triangle. The program also validates if the input side lengths can form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem.

## **Key Features**
- Interactive Interface: User-friendly prompts guide users to input side lengths effortlessly.
- Triangle Classification: The program classifies triangles into equilateral, scalene, or isosceles categories.
- Right Triangle Detection: It identifies right triangles based on the Pythagorean theorem.
- Input Validation: Validates if the input side lengths can form a valid triangle.
- Repeat Functionality: Users can rerun the program to classify more triangles.

## **How It Works:**

1. Input three side lengths of a triangle.
2. The program checks if these lengths can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.
3. It classifies the triangle into one of the following types: equilateral, scalene, isosceles, and determines if it's a right triangle.
4. Users can choose to run the program again to classify more triangles.
